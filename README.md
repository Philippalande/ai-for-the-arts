# ai-for-the-arts
Portfolio for 'AI for the arts' course. 
This repository is for my ai for the arts course in semester 2 of my juniour honours year at univeristy. My goals for the end of the course will be to have a good interpretation of AI, learn about Python & be able to use it at a beginner level. And to get a good grade in this class.

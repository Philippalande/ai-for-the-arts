# ai-for-the-arts
Portfolio for 'AI for the arts' course.
This repository is for my ai for the arts course in semester 2 of my **juniour honours year** at univeristy. 

My goals for the end of the course will be to 
- Learn about Python & be able to use it at a beginner level
- Achieve a good grade in this class.
- Have a good interpretation of AI. 


# My Machine Learning Portfolio

## Purpose

This repository showcases my work for a machine learning course, demonstrating my understanding of key concepts and my ability to apply them in practical projects. It serves as a collection of my work, including code, analyses, and reflections. The primary goal is to illustrate my development in machine learning and data analysis.

## Content

This repository contains the following notebooks:

1.  Coding Exercises and Reflections: (This notebook (weighted 20%) contains my coding exercises and reflections from the first part of the course. It demonstrates my initial understanding of Python and its application in machine learning. (Named - coding_exercises1.ipynb & coding_exersices2.ipynb)
2.  Critical Engagement with Machine Learning: This notebook (weighted 30%) consists of my critical engagement with machine learning concepts. It includes my reflections on the social, ethical, and cultural implications of machine learning technologies, and contains my answers to the questions in the notebook. 
3. Design of a Creative LLM Application: This notebook (weighted 30%) presents my design for a creative application of a large language model. It outlines the application's purpose, functionality, and potential impact. (Named - my_model.ipynb)

## Challenges 

Throughout this project, I encountered a few challenges:

Handling large files: I had an issue with an audio file provided on moodle that was too large to be rendered directly in the notebook. To address this, I cleared the output for that particular section.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and provides explanations, code examples, and my reflections on the topics covered.
